Questions:
1) ((Explain what this is in the context of an instance of a Person object.))
  this is person variable. we use this to refer to person attr, which (I think) will
  in a later instance of the project; put in their values of weight and height.
  right now we have given in fixed values, height: 179, weight: 76
    so basically, we could have printed out "person", instead of "this", but "this"
    in this case refers to person, since it owns all underlying attributes.
    similar to it in ruby.
2) ((Make sure you run through the whole code manually using the browsers console.
      What happens if you reload the page?))
I get 4 failures.
2) Person should calculate bmi value
  1a) [refference error], Person is not defined.
  1b) [type error], calculate_bmi is not defined.
2)Person should have BMI Message
  a)refference error, person is not defined.
  b)TypeError: Cannot read property 'calculate_bmi' of undefined


Question:
1) Why do we need to condition the finalBMI? (Why do we need an if statement?)

Answer:
1) Because, we need to specify that if weight or height is more than 0,
finalBMI should be the result of calculation with weight / (height / 100 * height / 100)
by the name finalBMI I can figure out that that it will eventually be the output of
the bmiValue.


Question:
1) Why does the setBMIMessage(obj); call do?
2) Why do we have a separate function called setBMIMessage?

Answer:

  1)
  It calls for the argument obj below which is either true or false, depending the value calculated out
  from BMICalculator.

  2)
  otherwise the obj would be used from above instead of below.
  above is (height and weight obj's)
  below is the if statements of the calculated that spans from 18.5 to 30.
  depending on the result, it will give you a message i.e: "obese" "normal" "overweight" et.c

Questions:

1) What is the $(document).ready... function?
2) Why are we using parseFloat($('#weight').val());?
3) What would happen if we did not include <script src="src/person.js"></script> in theindex.html source?
4) What line in index.html calls the method that calculates the BMI? What is happening on this line, in terms of the rest of the program?

  answers:
    1) It's loading the page before all functions, I guess its because the end-user shouldn't have to wait
      for functions to load.

    2) It's because in the form input, we allow text to be put in, and since text is not a definition of of calculation,
        we are not able to use it. That's why we use the parseFloat; to make sure that the inputed value is a number.
        That's what parseFloat does, it checks so the value input is a number.

    3) Nothing happens at all. In Person.js we bind person.function.calculate_bmi, which directs to calculate_bmi.js file
        containing the "blueprint" for how that "class" is to behave.

    4) I think line 16 calls for it, <<person.calculate_bmi();>> it's referring to the
    Simply because that's the last step of the process after line 12, <<$('#calculate').click(function () {>> which basically executes
    it's binding of .click, line 25 executes the order from the user, sending the information, referring back to line 12.
